Secure File-Sharing System
**Introduction
This project leverages cryptographic libraries to create a robust and secure file-sharing system. It provides users with the ability to log in, store files, and share files with others while ensuring data integrity and confidentiality in hostile environments.

**Functionality
The implementation comprises a set of eight essential functions that enable users to perform various file operations seamlessly. These functions are designed to offer a secure and dependable file-sharing experience:

InitUser - Initializes user accounts with robust security measures, preventing unauthorized access.

GetUser - Allows registered users to log in securely, protecting against password breaches.

StoreFile - Enables users to securely store and manage their files in a confidential and tamper-proof manner.

LoadFile - Provides the ability to retrieve files while ensuring their integrity and confidentiality.

AppendToFile - Allows for appending data to existing files securely, maintaining data integrity.

CreateInvitation: Create secure file sharing invitations, maintaining data confidentiality and access control.

AcceptInvitation: Allow users to securely accept file sharing invitations.

RevokeAccess: Provide the means to securely revoke access to shared files while ensuring data confidentiality.

Usage
To take full advantage of the secure file-sharing system, users can interact with these functions via well-defined APIs. Each function is carefully designed to offer a seamless, secure, and dependable file-sharing experience in a hostile environment.
